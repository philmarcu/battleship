## BattleShip - Requirements

The specifications give you some classes to help you start breaking this problem down, but you will also have to create some additional classes and methods to build an Object Oriented solution to this problem. This means that there should be very little code outside of a class and you are using your classes to create objects that interact in some way.

Additionally, this project will require you to use Test Driven Development for all methods that do not rely on user input. very few methods should rely on user input.
You and your partner are expected to commit frequently and use Pull Requests. Make sure you are doing this frequently throughout the project.
Please read the Rubric before getting started so that you know what is expected of you.

### Battleship - Overview

You are to build a playable game of Battleship that runs in a REPL interface. The game will allow a single human player to play against a (simplistic) computer player.
Both the Human Player and the Computer have a 4 x 4 board that holds their ships. Each of them has 2 ships: The Cruiser which is 3 cells long and The Submarine which is 2 cells. A board will look like this:

```
  1 2 3 4
A S S S .
B . . . .
C . S . .
D . S . .
```

Each S represents part of a ship and each . represents an empty space. In this case, the Cruiser is held in cells A1, A2, and A3, and the Submarine is held in cells C2 and D2.
During the main phase of the game, the computer and the player take turns firing at each other’s ships. The board shown above might look like this after a couple rounds of firing:

```
  1 2 3 4
A H S S .
B M . . M
C . X . .
D . X . .
```
Where H represents a hit, M represents a shot that missed, and X represents a sunken ship.
The Game is over when either the User or Computer sinks both enemy ships

## Iteration 1 - Ships and Cells

### Test Driven Development
In this iteration, you are required to use TDD to create your classes. Use the interaction pattern to determine what a method should do and write one or more tests to verify that expected behavior. Then you can implement the method. You should always write code with the purpose of making a test pass.

### Ship
A Ship object will represent a single ship on the board. It will be able to keep track of how much health it has, take hits, and report if it is sunk or not. A ship should start off with health equal to it’s length.

The Ship class should follow this interaction pattern:

``` ruby
pry(main)> require './lib/ship'
#=> true

pry(main)> cruiser = Ship.new("Cruiser", 3)
#=> #<Ship:0x00007feb05112d10...>

pry(main)> cruiser.name
#=> "Cruiser"

pry(main)> cruiser.length
#=> 3

pry(main)> cruiser.health
#=> 3

pry(main)> cruiser.sunk?
#=> false

pry(main)> cruiser.hit

pry(main)> cruiser.health
#=> 2

pry(main)> cruiser.hit

pry(main)> cruiser.health
#=> 1

pry(main)> cruiser.sunk?
#=> false

pry(main)> cruiser.hit

pry(main)> cruiser.sunk?
#=> true
```

### Cell

``` ruby
pry(main)> require './lib/ship'
# => true

pry(main)> require './lib/cell'
# => true

pry(main)> cell = Cell.new("B4")
# => #<Cell:0x00007f84f0ad4720...>

pry(main)> cell.coordinate
# => "B4"

pry(main)> cell.ship
# => nil

pry(main)> cell.empty?
# => true

pry(main)> cruiser = Ship.new("Cruiser", 3)
# => #<Ship:0x00007f84f0891238...>

pry(main)> cell.place_ship(cruiser)

pry(main)> cell.ship
# => #<Ship:0x00007f84f0891238...>

pry(main)> cell.empty?
# => false
Additionally, a cell knows when it has been fired upon. When it is fired upon, the cell’s ship should be damaged if it has one:

pry(main)> require './lib/ship'
# => true

pry(main)> require './lib/cell'
# => true

pry(main)> cell = Cell.new("B4")
# => #<Cell:0x00007f84f0ad4720...>

pry(main)> cruiser = Ship.new("Cruiser", 3)
# => #<Ship:0x00007f84f0891238...>

pry(main)> cell.place_ship(cruiser)

pry(main)> cell.fired_upon?
# => false

pry(main)> cell.fire_upon

pry(main)> cell.ship.health
# => 2

pry(main)> cell.fired_upon?
# => true
```

Finally, a Cell will have a method called ```render ```which returns a String representation of the Cell for when we need to print the board. A cell can potentially be rendered as:

”.” if the cell has not been fired upon.

“M” if the cell has been fired upon and it does not contain a ship (the shot was a miss).

“H” if the cell has been fired upon and it contains a ship (the shot was a hit).

“X” if the cell has been fired upon and its ship has been sunk.

Additionally, we will include an optional boolean argument to indicate if we want to reveal a ship in the cell even if it has not been fired upon. This should render a cell that has not been fired upon and contains a ship as an “S”. This will be useful for showing the user where they placed their ships and for debugging.


``` ruby
pry(main)> cell_1 = Cell.new("B4")
# => #<Cell:0x00007f84f11df920...>

pry(main)> cell_1.render
# => "."

pry(main)> cell_1.fire_upon

pry(main)> cell_1.render
# => "M"

pry(main)> cell_2 = Cell.new("C3")
# => #<Cell:0x00007f84f0b29d10...>

pry(main)> cruiser = Ship.new("Cruiser", 3)
# => #<Ship:0x00007f84f0ad4fb8...>

pry(main)> cell_2.place_ship(cruiser)

pry(main)> cell_2.render
# => "."

# Indicate that we want to show a ship with the optional argument
pry(main)> cell_2.render(true)
# => "S"

pry(main)> cell_2.fire_upon

pry(main)> cell_2.render
# => "H"

pry(main)> cruiser.sunk?
# => false

pry(main)> cruiser.hit

pry(main)> cruiser.hit

pry(main)> cruiser.sunk?
# => true

pry(main)> cell_2.render
# => "X"
```

## Iteration 2 - The Board

### Test Driven Development
In this iteration, you are required to use TDD to create your classes. Use the interaction pattern to determine what a method should do and write one or more tests to verify that expected behavior. Then you can implement the method. You should always write code with the purpose of making a test pass.

### Board
The Board class is responsible for keeping track of cells, validating coordinates, validating ship placements, placing ships, and rendering a visual representation of itself.

#### The Cells
The board is responsible for keeping track of all the cells. Since our board is 4 x 4, it will have 16 Cell objects. It will keep track of these cells in a hash where the coordinates of the cell are the keys that point to Cell objects:

``` ruby
pry(main)> require './lib/board'
# => true

pry(main)> board = Board.new
# => #<Board:0x00007ff0728c8010...>

pry(main)> board.cells
# =>
{
 "A1" => #<Cell:0x00007ff0728a3f58...>,
 "A2" => #<Cell:0x00007ff0728a3ee0...>,
 "A3" => #<Cell:0x00007ff0728a3e68...>,
 "A4" => #<Cell:0x00007ff0728a3df0...>,
 "B1" => #<Cell:0x00007ff0728a3d78...>,
 "B2" => #<Cell:0x00007ff0728a3d00...>,
 "B3" => #<Cell:0x00007ff0728a3c88...>,
 "B4" => #<Cell:0x00007ff0728a3c10...>,
 "C1" => #<Cell:0x00007ff0728a3b98...>,
 "C2" => #<Cell:0x00007ff0728a3b20...>,
 "C3" => #<Cell:0x00007ff0728a3aa8...>,
 "C4" => #<Cell:0x00007ff0728a3a30...>,
 "D1" => #<Cell:0x00007ff0728a39b8...>,
 "D2" => #<Cell:0x00007ff0728a3940...>,
 "D3" => #<Cell:0x00007ff0728a38c8...>,
 "D4" => #<Cell:0x00007ff0728a3850...>
}
```

Testing the #cells method is a bit tricky because the Cell objects are created in the Board class and not in our tests. We can’t specify exactly what the return value should be because we don’t have reference to the exact cell objects we expect in the hash. Instead, we can assert what we do know about this hash. It’s a hash, it should have 16 key/value pairs, and those keys point to cell objects.

### Validating Coordinates

Our board should be able to tell us if a coordinate is on the board or not:

``` ruby
pry(main)> board.valid_coordinate?("A1")
# => true

pry(main)> board.valid_coordinate?("D4")
# => true

pry(main)> board.valid_coordinate?("A5")
# => false

pry(main)> board.valid_coordinate?("E1")
# => false

pry(main)> board.valid_coordinate?("A22")
# => false
```

### Validating Placements

Additionally, a Board should be able to tell us if a placement for a ship is valid or not. Our Board should have a method called valid_placement? that takes two arguments: a Ship object and an array of Coordinates.

There are many things we need to check for validating ship placement. Let’s use this setup:

``` ruby
pry(main)> require './lib/board'
# => true

pry(main)> require './lib/ship'
# => true

pry(main)> board = Board.new
# => #<Board:0x00007fcb0d9db478...>

pry(main)> cruiser = Ship.new("Cruiser", 3)
# => #<Ship:0x00007fcb0d989510...>

pry(main)> submarine = Ship.new("Submarine", 2)    
# => #<Ship:0x00007fcb0e8402c0...>
```

First, the number of coordinates in the array should be the same as the length of the ship:

``` ruby
pry(main)> board.valid_placement?(cruiser, ["A1", "A2"])
# => false

pry(main)> board.valid_placement?(submarine, ["A2", "A3", "A4"])
# => false
```

Next, make sure the coordinates are consecutive:

``` ruby
pry(main)> board.valid_placement?(cruiser, ["A1", "A2", "A4"])
# => false

pry(main)> board.valid_placement?(submarine, ["A1", "C1"])
# => false

pry(main)> board.valid_placement?(cruiser, ["A3", "A2", "A1"])
# => false

pry(main)> board.valid_placement?(submarine, ["C1", "B1"])
# => false
```

Finally, coordinates can’t be diagonal:

``` ruby
pry(main)> board.valid_placement?(cruiser, ["A1", "B2", "C3"])
# => false

pry(main)> board.valid_placement?(submarine, ["C2", "D3"])
# => false
```

If all the previous checks pass then the placement should be valid:

``` ruby
pry(main)> board.valid_placement?(submarine, ["A1", "A2"])
# => true

pry(main)> board.valid_placement?(cruiser, ["B1", "C1", "D1"])
# => true
```

Note that all of the different cases listed above should be their own tests. This will help you break this problem down into small steps and working on them one at a time. You should not have one big test for validating placement.

### Tools for validation
There are many ways to go about the validation. Here are some ideas to help you get started:

#### Ranges
Ruby has a built in Class called Range. It has a special syntax:

```ruby
pry(main)> range = 3..8
# => 3..8

pry(main)> range.class
# => Range
```

The first element (in this case 3) is the start of the range and the second is the end of the range.

You can turn a Range into an Array quite easily and then do Array stuff:

```ruby
pry(main)> range = 3..8
# => 3..8

pry(main)> array = range.to_a
# => [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]

pry(main)> array.length
# => 6

pry(main)> array[3]
# => 6
```

This also works with Strings:

``` ruby
pry(main)> range = "A".."D"
# => "A".."D"

pry(main)> range.to_a
# => ["A", "B", "C", "D"]
```

#### Ordinal Values
The Range with Strings works because each character has an implicit value that tells us in what order the characters should be. This is called the Ordinal Value, and you can access it with the ord method for Strings:

```ruby
pry(main)> "A".ord
# => 65

pry(main)> "D".ord
# => 68
```

#### Helpful Enumerables
Ruby has an enumerable method called ```each_cons``` that allows you to access consecutive elements in a collection. See the Ruby Docs for more details.

Also consider if the enumerables ```any?```, ```all?```, ```none?``` would be helpful.

#### Placing Ships
The board should be able to place a ship in its cells. Because a Ship occupies more than one cell, multiple Cells will contain the same ship. This is a little brain bendy at first, but it is a very important concept. This is Object Oriented Programming in a nutshell.

```ruby
pry(main)> require './lib/board'
# => true

pry(main)> require './lib/ship'
# => true

pry(main)> board = Board.new
# => #<Board:0x00007fcb0e1f6720...>

pry(main)> cruiser = Ship.new("Cruiser", 3)    
# => #<Ship:0x00007fcb0e1ffa28...>

pry(main)> board.place(cruiser, ["A1", "A2", "A3"])    

pry(main)> cell_1 = board.cells["A1"]    
# => #<Cell:0x00007fcb0e1f66a8...>

pry(main)> cell_2 = board.cells["A2"]
# => #<Cell:0x00007fcb0e1f6630...>

pry(main)> cell_3 = board.cells["A3"]    
# => #<Cell:0x00007fcb0e1f65b8...>

pry(main)> cell_1.ship
# => #<Ship:0x00007fcb0e1ffa28...>

pry(main)> cell_2.ship
# => #<Ship:0x00007fcb0e1ffa28...>

pry(main)> cell_3.ship
# => #<Ship:0x00007fcb0e1ffa28...>

pry(main)> cell_3.ship == cell_2.ship
# => true
```

### Overlapping Ships
``` ruby
pry(main)> require './lib/board'
# => true

pry(main)> require './lib/ship'
# => true

pry(main)> board = Board.new
# => #<Board:0x00007fcb0e1f6720...>

pry(main)> cruiser = Ship.new("Cruiser", 3)
# => #<Ship:0x00007fcb0d92b5f0...>

pry(main)> board.place(cruiser, ["A1", "A2", "A3"])

pry(main)> submarine = Ship.new("Submarine", 2)    
# => #<Ship:0x00007fcb0dace9c0...>

pry(main)> board.valid_placement?(submarine, ["A1", "B1"])
# => false
```

### Rendering the Board
Our board needs to be able to render a String representation of itself to display to the user all of its cells in a formatted grid. Each Cell should be displayed using the rules from Iteration 1:

”.” if the cell has not been fired upon.

“M” if the cell has been fired upon and it does not contain a ship (the shot was a miss).

“H” if the cell has been fired upon and it contains a ship (the shot was a hit).

“X” if the cell has been fired upon and its ship has been sunk. Note that all of the cells that contain that sunken ship should render as an “X”, not just the cell that resulted in the ship being sunk.

And just like with cells, we will include an optional argument to indicate whether we want to show hidden ships.

``` ruby
pry(main)> require './lib/board'
# => true

pry(main)> require './lib/ship'
# => true

pry(main)> board = Board.new
# => #<Board:0x00007fcb0f056860...>

pry(main)> cruiser = Ship.new("Cruiser", 3)    
# => #<Ship:0x00007fcb0f0573f0...>

pry(main)> board.place(cruiser, ["A1", "A2", "A3"])    

pry(main)> board.render
# => "  1 2 3 4 \nA . . . . \nB . . . . \nC . . . . \nD . . . . \n"

pry(main)> board.render(true)
# => "  1 2 3 4 \nA S S S . \nB . . . . \nC . . . . \nD . . . . \n"
```

You can format strings on multiple lines using concatenation to make them more readable. The two return values from above can be written as:

``` ruby
"  1 2 3 4 \n" +
"A . . . . \n" +
"B . . . . \n" +
"C . . . . \n" +
"D . . . . \n"

"  1 2 3 4 \n" +
"A S S S . \n" +
"B . . . . \n" +
"C . . . . \n" +
"D . . . . \n"
```

As you move forward, you will need to add functionality to your game so that you can fire on Cells and damage their Ships. When you do this, you should also add new tests for your render method that it can render with Hits, Misses, and Sunken Ships. A Board in the middle of a game might be rendered as something like this:

``` ruby
"  1 2 3 4 \n" +
"A H . . . \n" +
"B . . . M \n" +
"C X . . . \n" +
"D X . . . \n"

"  1 2 3 4 \n" +
"A H S S . \n" +
"B . . . M \n" +
"C X . . . \n" +
"D X . . . \n"
```

## Iteration 3 - Building the Game

Now it’s time to put together the components you’ve built in the last two iterations to make a working game. You are allowed to build any additional classes or methods you think may be useful to accomplish this. However, this project will be assessed on the spec outlined in the last two iterations, so don’t remove any of the functionality from the Ship, Cell, or Board classes.

You are not expected to test anything related to user input and output in this iteration, but try to use TDD as much as possible to help you design your solution.

You are not expected to follow the Game described below exactly. If you want to give your computer player more personality, feel free to do so. However, the information relayed to the user and received from the user should not change. For instance, when firing a shot you are not allowed to omit displaying the result of the shot (hit, miss, sink) to the user. For your convenience, at the end of this page you will find a checklist that summarizes all of the functionality you are expected to build.

You are expected to build at least one additional class to complete this iteration. This can be a single class that is responsible for running the game. You should have very little code that is not contained in a class.

### Main Menu
When the user starts the game, they should see a welcome message that asks them if they want to play or quit. Whenever a game ends, they should return to this message so they can start a new game, or quit.

``` ruby
Welcome to BATTLESHIP
Enter p to play. Enter q to quit.
```

### Setup
Once the User has chosen to play, you need to place the computer’s ships and the players ships to set up the game.

#### Computer Ship Placement
The computer player should place their ships. The baseline computer should simply use random placements but still adhere to the valid placement rules from iteration 2.

#### Player Ship Placement
Next, the user places their ships. They should receive a short explanation of how to place along with a visual representation of their board (which should be empty).

``` ruby
I have laid out my ships on the grid.
You now need to lay out your two ships.
The Cruiser is three units long and the Submarine is two units long.
  1 2 3 4
A . . . .
B . . . .
C . . . .
D . . . .
Enter the squares for the Cruiser (3 spaces):
>
```

When the user enters a valid sequence of spaces, the ship should be placed on the board, the new board with the ship should be shown to the user, and then the user should be asked to place the other ship.

``` ruby
Enter the squares for the Cruiser (3 spaces):
> A1 A2 A3

  1 2 3 4
A S S S .
B . . . .
C . . . .
D . . . .
Enter the squares for the Submarine (2 spaces):
>
```

If the user enters an invalid sequence, they should be prompted again:

``` ruby
Enter the squares for the Submarine (2 spaces):
> C1 C3
Those are invalid coordinates. Please try again:
> A1 B1
Those are invalid coordinates. Please try again:
> C1 D1
```

### The Turn
During the main game, players take turns firing at one another by selecting positions on the grid to attack.

A single turn consists of:

Displaying the boards
Player choosing a coordinate to fire on
Computer choosing a coordinate to fire on
Reporting the result of the Player’s shot
Reporting the result of the Computer’s shot

#### Displaying the Boards
At the start of the turn, the user is shown both boards. The user should see their ships but not the computer’s ships:

``` ruby
=============COMPUTER BOARD=============
  1 2 3 4
A M . . M
B . . . .
C . . . .
D . . . .
==============PLAYER BOARD==============
  1 2 3 4
A S S S .
B . M . .
C M . S .
D . . S .
```

#### Player Shot
The player should be asked for a coordinate to fire on. If they enter an invalid coordinate, they should be prompted until they enter a valid one:

``` ruby
Enter the coordinate for your shot:
> D5
Please enter a valid coordinate:
> Z1
Please enter a valid coordinate:
> A4
```

#### Computer Shot
The computer should choose a random space on the board. The computer should not fire on a space that has already been fired on.

#### Results
The results of the shots should be displayed:

``` ruby
Your shot on A4 was a miss.
My shot on C1 was a miss.
```
The game needs to handle all of the following results:

A shot missed
A shot hit a ship
A shot sunk a ship

#### Coordinates that have already been fired upon

It is possible that the user enters a coordinate they have already fired upon. You need to add something that informs the user that this is the case. You may choose to either prompt them again for a coordinate they haven’t fired on, or let them choose it again and inform them in the results phase that they selected this coordinate again.

### End Game
The game is over when either the computer or the user sinks all of the enemy ships. When this happens, the user should see a message stating who won:

```You won!```

Then, they should be returned to the Main Menu asking them if they would like to play or quit.

### Functionality Checklist
This checklist summarizes all of the functionality you are expected to build. This will be used to assess the completion of your project:

#### Main Menu:

User is shown the main menu where they can play or quit

#### Setup:

Computer can place ships randomly in valid locations
User can enter valid sequences to place both ships
Entering invalid ship placements prompts user to enter valid placements

#### Turn:

Computer board is displayed showing hits, misses, and sunken ships
Computer chooses a random shot
Computer does not fire on the same spot twice
User can choose a valid coordinate to fire on
Entering invalid coordinate prompts user to enter valid coordinate
Both computer and player shots are reported as a hit, sink, or miss
User is informed when they have already fired on a coordinate
Board is updated after a turn

#### End Game:

Game ends when all the user’s ships are sunk
Game ends when all the computer’s ships are sunk
Game reports who won
Game returns user back to the Main Menu
